/**
 * Represents the grid of a Connect Four game.
 * Note: The first position in a column has row index 0, which means that when you display the
 * Grid you'll show the rows in order of decreasing index, which is the opposite of TextExcel.
 * For example, consider a game that starts with these four moves:
 * Player 1 moves in column 2, which drops to row 0
 * Player 2 moves in column 3, which drops to row 0
 * Player 1 moves in column 3, which drops to row 1
 * Player 2 moves in column 3, which drops to row 2
 * The grid would look like this:
 * |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 * |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 * |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 * |   |   |   | 2 |   |   |   |
 * |   |   |   | 1 |   |   |   |
 * |   |   | 1 | 2 |   |   |   |
 *  --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
 *   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
